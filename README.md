countryState
============

Michael John Grove has created an excellent Javascript tool which allows
countries and states to be selected on a webform. See:

http://darwinshome.co.za/2008/03/javascript-xml-based-country-state-selection-script/

However, the included XML file is incorrect (some states are mixed up and appear
with the wrong countries, and some countries do not even exist in the file).

With a bit of research I've created a proper UTF8 formatted version, with
the correct countries and states.

The data was retrieved from http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/ and then
cleaned up, formatted and restructured for the javascript.

Enjoy!
